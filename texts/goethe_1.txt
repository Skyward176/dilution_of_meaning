 Do not remind me of that motley throng,

Spare me the sight of them! Our spirits fail          60

And flounder in that stream, we are swept along,

Against the unruly flood what can prevail?

Give me the quietness where I belong,

The poet’s place, the stillness never stale,

The love and friendship! Only there our art

Thrives on the blessed nurture of the heart.

Deep in the soul an impulse there can flow,

An early song still lisping and unclear;

Well-formed or ill, its momentary show

Too soon from Time’s wild crest will disappear.          70

Often unseen and darkly it must grow,

Reaching its ripeness after many a year.

What glisters is the moment’s, born to be

Soon lost; true gold lives for posterity.
