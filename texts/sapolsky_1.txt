So, it seems that William James was giving a lecture about the nature of life and the universe. Afterward, an old woman came up and said, “Professor James, you have it all wrong.”

To which James asked, “How so, madam?”

“Things aren’t at all like you said,” she replied. “The world is on the back of a gigantic turtle.”

“Hmm.” said James, bemused. “That may be so, but where does that turtle stand?”

“On the back of another turtle,” she answered.

“But madam,” said James indulgently, “where does that turtle stand?”

To which the old woman responded triumphantly: “It’s no use, Professor James. It’s turtles all the way down!”
